            I was just a man with an ideea but 2 weeks later I was a man with a plan. We jumped on this
            adventure and learned a lot along the way. Two days after launching we had our first client. In
            what we do, being creative is crucial. And we love the moments when we have to make our brain
            work and produce new, crazy, beautiful ideas.</p>
